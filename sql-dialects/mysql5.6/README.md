MySQL 5.6
=========
This directory defines modules as specified in the parent directory's
[readme file](../README.md). The target SQL dialect is
[version 5.6 of MySQL][1]. It would not be surprising if MySQL mantained
backward compatibility, so this implementation might continue to work for
future versions of the database, but the target version is 5.6.
